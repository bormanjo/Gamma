# Project Gamma 
A Simple Trading Platform

Current State:
  There is a basic/generic terminal that pulls realtime data from the yahoo_finance module. The available data can be found by
  calling the programs help function which will return a list of recognized functions and their result.
  
Next Update:
  Basic Portfolio logging. Will use file I/O to track and record the number of shares purchased, the change in price, 
  the subsequent profits or losses, the current price, and the purchased price.

This a simple stock trading platform built from the ground up using IPython, myplotlib, and yahoo_finance.
