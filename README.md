# Project Gamma 
A Simulated Trading Platform

NOTICE: Development has temporarily been suspended. Please see Future heading below.

Current State:
  - There is a basic/generic terminal that pulls realtime data from a Python yahoo_finance API. There are two main functionalities: Terminal and Portfolio.
  - Terminal allows for basic access to an array of stock data from the current price to trading volume to the stock's Price-to-Earnings Ratio and more.
  - Portfolio allows for a user to create an account with a username and password. They will then be able to make trades and purchase stocks which are logged and recorded under their account.
  - Currently, users may only trade Equities.

Future:
  - Efforts are now focused towards a more versatile equity analysis platform utilizing Python (for its data analysis features) and R (for its ability to handle large data sets). This new project will eventually become absorbed by the current Project Gamma platform in Beta 1.5 and will have a fully functional GUI upon exiting Beta Development.

A simple, simulated stock trading platform built from the ground up using a yahoo_finance API.
